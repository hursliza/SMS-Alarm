# SMS-Alarm

- Android application in Java
- Gets SMS messages which match the pattern from the inbox 
- If the function of setting alarm is turned on (using android switch), puts on a system alarm clock

The purpose of the application is to make sure that the important messages(for example matching the same company pattern) will be seen by the user immediately. To achieve this, the app sets a system alarm clock, which goes off a minute after it gets a message. Setting alarm clock can be turned off using a simple toggle button at the top of the screen.
